## The University: CESAR School <a id="the-university-cesar-school"></a>

[CESAR School](https://www.cesar.school), [CESAR](https://www.cesar.org.br)'s non-profit school of innovation, strives to form professionals capable of fomenting and executing projects that bring upon relevant changes to society. Student formation focuses on developing a scientific and technical point of views as well as interpersonal and intrapersonal skills. To achieve this, the university makes use of Problem-Based Learning \(PBL\).

PBL is a teaching method that takes advantage of complex real-world problems, using them as vehicle to promote student learning, working on concepts and principles as opposed to direct presentation of facts and concepts. Throughout the process, we develop, in addition to critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities and communication skills, empathy, skills in agile methodologies and teamwork.

In addition to it all, we are Based in the [Porto Digital](http://www.portodigital.org/home) area \([Recife, Brazil](https://goo.gl/maps/VYs9rRKP72T2)\) - a major tech and innovation center in Latin America, with [more than 200 companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Digital) -, in addition to having ties with hundreds of other entities around the world. 

## The Client: L.O.U.Co <a id="the-client-l-o-u-co"></a>

[L.O.U.Co](http://www.portodigital.org/diferenciais/equipamentos/louco), the Lab for Connected Urban Objects, is open to society for creation, development and prototyping os solutions that improve quality of life in the urban space. The Lab, also located in the  [Porto Digital](http://www.portodigital.org/home) area, partnered up with several educational institutions, companies and research projects in order to promote meet-ups and workshops.

During these events, staff and partners/supporters at L.O.U.Co educate on how digital fabrication enables physical objects to feel their surroundings and communicate with them. The space provides users with 3D printers and scanners, laser cutters, electric circuit printers a milling machine an a full spectrum of sensors and actuators.

Engaging the multidisciplinary groups in the [Porto Digital](http://www.portodigital.org/home) area, from Computer Science and Electronics to Health and Design related areas, to develop digital fabrication solutions not only reduces the distance between the Academy, market and society, as it may also \[one day\] enable physical objects to communicate beyond their surroundings - maybe people, or even entire cities.

## The Problem: ?

\[problem here\]

## The Solution: NESS! 

In order to overcome the burden of mechanical and exhaustive tasks and activities which stifle innovation, us at ALPACK - in partnership with CESAR School and L.O.U.Co \(Lab for Connected Urban Objects\) - decided to approach things somewhat differently. The goal is to gamify repetitive and time consuming, but necessary, activities in order to promote collaboration and learning alongside assuring that each individual is the protagonist of their journey. In five months, the team delivered an MVP to L.O.U.Co, which will enabled to bring to life a journey's game-like epicness.

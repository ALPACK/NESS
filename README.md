# Project NESS

## NESS

In order to overcome the burden of mechanical and exhaustive tasks and activities which stifle innovation, us at ALPACK - in partnership with CESAR School and L.O.U.Co \(Labotat√≥rio de Objetos Urbanos Conectados\) - decided to approach things somewhat differently. The goal is to gamify repetitive and time consuming, but necessary, activities in order to promote collaboration and learning. In the next couple months, the team will deliver an MVP which the user will be able to bring to life game-like elements.

## GETTING STARTED

Clone the project's repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/alpack/NESS.git
```

Use makefile to create the necessary directories:

```
$ make database
// if you need some mock data, we got you! 
// $ make mockfiles
```

Now, you can build the project and enjoy our application!

```text
$ make
$ cd bin
./NESS 
#Enjoy!
```
